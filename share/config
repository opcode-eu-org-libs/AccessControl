#
# * one "door" per line
# * each doors support two readers A and B
# * door can support multiple subdoors (e.g. buildings level for elevators)
#
# doorname = name of door for this controller used in database (use % replaced subdoor numeric id, e.g. buildings level for elevators)
# mode_A          = mode for reader A:
#	0x01 (only card)
#	0x02 (only pin)
#	0x10 (card OR pin)
#	0x20 (card AND pin)
#	0x30 (ALWAYS card AND pin, even for cards allowing usage without pin)
#	0x40 (card compare / two card; e.g. physical key access management: first card personal, second card tag for key)
# serial_dev_A    = device for communication with reader A
# rs485_A         = 1 when reader A comunication is RS485 half duplex
# address_A       = address for reader A
# mode_B          = same as above but for reader B (- for disable second reader)
# serial_dev_B    = same as above but for reader B (- for disable second reader)
# rs485_B,        = same as above but for reader B (- for disable second reader)
# address_B       = same as above but for reader B (- for disable second reader)
# maskOffset      = output offset (typically used as 1 for second door on this same controler)
# fullMask        = mask GPIO outputs for all subdoors (0x01 for standard doors, e.g. 0x0f for 4 levels elevator)
# airLockPartner  = name of airlock partner (- for disable airlock)
